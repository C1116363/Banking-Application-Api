Banking Application
This project is a Banking Application built using Spring Boot, which provides RESTful APIs to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on banking entities such as accounts, transactions, and customers. It utilizes Spring Data JPA for easy database access and management.

Features:
* RESTful APIs: Exposes endpoints to perform CRUD operations on banking entities.
* Spring Data JPA: Simplifies database access and management by providing easy-to-use abstractions over JDBC.
* Secure Authentication: Implements authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure sensitive banking operations.
* Scalable Architecture: Designed with scalability in mind, allowing the application to handle increased loads effectively.
* Robust Error Handling: Implements robust error handling mechanisms to provide meaningful error messages to clients

Technologies Used:
* Spring Boot: Provides a powerful framework for building web applications.
* Spring Data JPA: Simplifies database access and management using the Java Persistence API (JPA).
* Spring Security: Implements authentication and authorization for securing endpoints.
* H2 Database: Lightweight, in-memory database for development and testing purposes.
* Maven: Dependency management tool for building and managing Java-based projects.
